        <p class="lead">I am committed to preparing and delivering a ceremony that is unique and I will seek to make the occasion personal and very special.</p>
        <p>When  someone you love dies, and you have to say goodbye for the very last  time, you want that occasion to be as individual and unique as they were. You want  to picture them through the words that are spoken, feel them through the  music that is played, and take comfort in the fact that their story was  told and their life given meaning.</p>
        <p>I will focus on family and friends, school and working life, interests and achievements, favourite memories and stories. I will seek to involve others who wish to participate and truly capture the character of the deceased. I will look to include unusual ways of marking your loss; ways that are meaningful to you, yet inclusive to all.</p>
        <p>A  civil funeral is centered around your personal preferences. It provides  a meaningful, respectful ceremony that truly reflects the person who  has died, whatever their spiritual beliefs or background.</p>
        <p>Civil funerals can be held at crematoriums or public cemeteries and natural burial sites.</p>
        <p>I will work closely with you to compose and conduct a  ceremony that captures the essence of the person who has died, and  reflects the feelings of those who loved and knew them best.</p>

          <p>I have to say you conducted it with the utmost professionalism, it was personal to us and very comforting. Actually my son said "Who is that man mum, is he a family member we haven't met?" which says it all. Thank you so much I know Dad would have liked you very much.</p>
