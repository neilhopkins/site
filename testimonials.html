          <h1>Life's journey</h1>
          <p>Life’s journey is like a story; it has a beginning, middle and an end. Love is like a thread running through all the special events during our personal journey. It may be the delightful love of welcoming and naming a new baby. It may be the loyal, faithful love of two people joining in marriage or civil partnership. It may be the sad love of saying farewell at the end of life. At every stage of our life’s journey we are changed and our lives are re-shaped forever. Celebrancy can help you mark these special occasions with love and in a way that captures the very personal nature of your own story.</p>
