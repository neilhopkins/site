      <div class="col-md-7">
        <p class="lead">Born in Hongkong, I spent my early life in various parts of the UK and Europe as my father was a member of the Royal Air Force. Our family settled in Cwmbran in 1976 and I have lived in the area ever since.</p>
        <p>I have spent my working life as a public servant and I have developed invaluable experience in dealing with people from all walks of life. I decided to become a civil funeral celebrant in 2011 because I felt that people should have a choice when it comes to the way they wish to commemorate the lives of their loved ones.  Since my training I have conducted a large number of funeral services and I am a Member of the Institute of Civil Funerals. In 2015 I further trained to conduct naming ceremonies, weddings and civil partnerships. I am fully qualified to officiate at all the above events.</p>
        <p>I am committed to helping you plan and deliver a service that captures the very special nature of the occasion and tells the story of those important people at the centre of the family event.</p>

          <h1>Life's journey</h1>
          <p>Life’s journey is like a story; it has a beginning, middle and an end. Love is like a thread running through all the special events during our personal journey. It may be the delightful love of welcoming and naming a new baby. It may be the loyal, faithful love of two people joining in marriage or civil partnership. It may be the sad love of saying farewell at the end of life. At every stage of our life’s journey we are changed and our lives are re-shaped forever. Celebrancy can help you mark these special occasions with love and in a way that captures the very personal nature of your own story.</p>
